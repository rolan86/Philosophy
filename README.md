My Own Philosophies

Some ideas that have come to me from time to time after going through my short life

1. The thought of finding balance (work-life balance being a common example) is a mere illusion, no such thing exists; a point of balance is something which is ever shifting, and sometimes you only realize for a mere moment, that you just achieved it, and it goes off again (until you find it again). That moment is blissful.
