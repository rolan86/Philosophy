My Own Philosophies

Some ideas that have come to me from time to time after going through my short life

1. The thought of finding balance (work-life balance being a common example) is a mere illusion, no such thing exists; a point of balance is something which is ever shifting, and sometimes you only realize for a mere moment, that you just achieved it, and it goes off again (until you find it again). That moment is blissful.

2. You truth is not necessarily my truth

3. Money is not your only currency.




Not mine, but I like them:
1. No citizen has a right to be an amateur in the matter of physical trainingâ€¦what a disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable. - Socrates
